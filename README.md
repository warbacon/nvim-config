## üö© Introduction

**Miovim** doesn't rely on `lazy.nvim` or any external plugin manager.  Instead,
it uses [`vim.pack`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html#_plugin-manager) ‚Äî
Neovim's upcoming **native plugin manager**, still under development. Expect
some rough edges.

This approach enables an extremely minimal configuration, but comes with a
trade-off: **native lazy loading isn't yet supported**.

To mitigate this, `vim.loader` is enabled for faster startup. I might take a
look at [`lz.n`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lz.n) at some point.

## üì¶ Dependencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Miovim does not use
> [Mason.nvim](https://github.com/mason-org/mason.nvim).** Language servers
> and external tools must be installed manually or through your system's package
> manager. This configuration is primarily developed and used on **NixOS**, but
> it's adaptable to other environments.

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- A **C compiler**
- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) *(optional on Linux/macOS,
  but recommended)*
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) *(optional but recommended)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### üêß Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, WSL...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warbacon/nvim-config "$HOME/.config/nvim"
```

### ü™ü Windows

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Neovim is slower on Windows. Using
> [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warbacon/nvim-config "$HOME\AppData\Local\nvim"
```
